		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
				This project implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_Algorithm_X">algorithm X</a> (as described by
				 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>) in javascript using the <a
						href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links">dancing links</a> data structure. Knuth's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf">paper</a>
				is readable and interesting (with diagrams that definitely help).   The intention is that this code be documented, readable,
				tested, and that it can work on node.js, in the browser or in Rhino.
		</p>

		<h2>Exact Cover Problem</h2>

		<p>The Exact Cover Problem is an optimisation problem. Given a set of constraints that must be satisfied and a set of
				choices, each of which satisfies one or more of the constraints, you need to select a subset of the possible choices that
				ensures that every constraint is satisfied once and only once.</p>

		<p>Here's my favourite explanation:</p>

		<blockquote>
				<p>Lets say, you're doing your exam for your piano grade. Lets think of the columns not as columns, but as a precise list
						of tricks you must show to the examiner that you are able to do before he/she can give you the pass. The examiner is also
						very easily bored, and will immediately fail you if you do the same trick twice. Now, think of the rows not as rows, but as
						an exact song list you can choose from to play to the examiner. You may choose one or more songs from your list of songs.
						You can choose to play all the songs in your list. Songs can show the examiner different tricks, so she/he can mark you off
						for them. You must pick a set of songs such that every trick on the examiner's list is fufilled exactly once.</p>

		</blockquote>

		<p>As it turns out, a number of well known problems can be represented as Exact Cover problems, such as Sudoku, Pentonimos,
				N-Queens.</p>

		<h2>Getting Started</h2>

		<p>
				Check the code out with git from the <a href="https://github.com/kybernetikos/dancing-links">github repository</a>:
				git://github.com/kybernetikos/dancing-links.git
		</p>

		<p>You can also access it on <a href="http://c9.io/kybernetikos/dancing-links">cloud9</a>.</p>

		<p>Ideally you would have node.js installed, in which case you can run the tests by using</p>

		<pre><code>npm test</code></pre>

		<p>inside the project, or you can run them with build\runtests.cmd (I have been developing in eclipse on windows).</p>

		<p>You can run the devserver after getting the dependencies with</p>

		<pre><code>npm install 
npm start</code></pre>

		<p>Which will start up a web server that serves the bundled js file containing all the code so you can access the files from
				the browser. It will also automatically rebuild and serve the jsdoc too.</p>

		<p>If you don't have node, within eclipse you can use 'debug as rhino' on the rhino-index.js file to see some sudoku solved 
		(very slow - node is much faster).</p>

		<h2>The Code</h2>
		
		<p>Algorithm X works by searching all the possibilities, back-tracking as soon as it finds that a certain option isn't working.
		See Knuth's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf">paper</a> for more details.</p>
		
		<p>Dancing links is a particular way of implementing algorithm X that turns out to perform well in many cases.</p>
		
		<p>Picture the problem as being written out in table form.  Each column represents a <tt>Constraint</tt>, something that must
		be satisfied exactly once in any solution.  For Sudoku, an example constraint is 'there must be a 1 in the first row'.  For Polyonimos
		an example constraint is 'the square piece must be placed somewhere on the board'. In the example above, the piano techniques
		are the <tt>Constraints</tt>. The rows represent <tt>Choice</tt>s that you can make.  In the above example, these are the piano pieces
		that you select from.  In Sudoku, a choice might be 'write 3 in the first cell of the first column'.  In polyonimos, a choice might
		be 'place the square piece so it's top left corner is at 0,0'.</p>
		
		<p>Typically, there will be many hundreds of rows and columns to adequately capture a problem.</p>
		
		<p>Dancing links is a technique to make it very quick to remove things from this table and then add them again if it didn't work out.</p>
		
		<p>The code has a generic dancing links implementation called <tt>Network</tt>, and extra code that uses that <tt>Network</tt> to 
		solve specific puzzles, like Sudoku or Polyonimos.</p>

		<h2>Sudoku</h2>

    <p>Sudoku can be represented as an exact cover problem.  There is a constraint for each number in each row, column and area. (i.e. a
    constraint that there be a 1 in row 1 (and likewise for each row, column and area), a constraint that there be a 2 in row 1 (and likewise
    for each row, column and area).</p>
    <p>The choices are for each cell, a number being written into it. So one choice might be '1 in cell 1', another might be '2 in cell 1'.</p>

		<p>Try it here:
			<pre id='puzzleDisplay'></pre>
			<input id='puzzle' onkeyup='sudokuUpdated()' value='.6.3..8.4537.9.....4...63.7.9..51238.........71362..4.3.64...1.....6.5231.2..9.8.' style='width: 43em' />
			<button onclick='solveEnteredSudoku()'>Solve</button>
		</p>

		<h2>Polyonimos</h2>

		<p>Polyonimos can also be represented as an exact cover problem.  There are two kinds of constraints, cell constriants, which 
		represent the fact that every cell must be covered, and shape constraints, which represent the fact that every shape must be used.</p>
		
		<p>There is a choice for every place that each shape can be placed.</p>
